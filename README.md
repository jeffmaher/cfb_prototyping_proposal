# Code for Boston Prototype Team Proposal

## Proposal Submission (Google Form)
How might we prototype better digital services for existing government services? 

Here's the idea: identify some existing online services offered by the City of Boston (or the State, or City of X) and create multiple prototypes on how they might be better. A few notes: 

1. Prototype doesn't necessarily mean build code. Maybe it's paper prototypes, clickable mockups, or some some user research findings from something that already exists.
2. It'd be great to see if the Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics (or Mass Digital Services) has some projects that they're too busy to work on that we might be able to start doing thought work on. I'm happy to get in touch with folks at the City or State.
3. Sustainability and budget for infrastructure are two huge weaknesses of Brigade projects. By only building prototypes and not intending to build production-ready apps, we avoid those problems while still potentially being able to help out and be heard.

## Project Scope
### Problem Statement
How might we prototype better digital services for existing government services?

Other related problem statements:
- How might we, local residents, learn more about how our government operates and services it offers?
- How might we make new and/or stronger connections to our local civil servants?
- How might we learn more about the needs of people in our community?
- How might we improve our UX design skills?
- How might we increase the prototyping and design capacity/competency of CfB as an organization?

### Defined Users
Rather than defining a specific problem or a specific app, this is calling for the creation of a group of people that can visually design and prototype digital services for fellow local residents. Explicitly, this is not about building a production-ready web application. To do this, the group can begin learning about current local government services and design/re-design current offerings. Ideally, this is done with **local civil servants** as the intended audience of the group's outputs. However, this prototype design could be collected in portfolio such that **civil servants in other localities** can also lift the team's designs. Lastly, **design professionals currently working government** may also want to re-use the works.

### Timeline
This is a brainstorm: rotate the service being designed/prototyped every 2-3 months.

For example, if we were digging into unemployment (State level):

- **Month 1**: 
	- Do a prototyping and user research session (Jeff or other experienced folks can lead)
	- Choose a service (example: online unemployment registration)
	- Learn about the service
	- Conduct a UX teardown (if there is a pre-existing digital service, [example](https://medium.com/@little_wow/notes-from-an-unemployed-information-architect-f5ffd87471b1))
	- Chat with civil servants during CfB hours (i.e. phone call, video chat, civil servant comes to CfB)
	- (Unlikely to happen, but would be good to try) Chat with folks that recently used the service  during CfB hours (i.e. phone call, video chat, civil servant comes to CfB)
	- Document findings per UX teardown and conversations with stakeholders and users
- **Month 2**:
	- White board or paper prototype
	- Create digital wireframes (Sketch/Illustrator)
	- Make prototypes clickable (either paper prototype or digital wireframes into something like InVision)
	-  (Unlikely to happen, but would be good to try)  Conduct a user research interview
- **Month 3**:
	- Show and handoff prototype to civil servants during CfB hours
	- Present out to CfB members on what the service is, lessons learned, and the prototype itself
- **Month 4**:
	- (Start back at *Month 1*)

Because CfB has lots of newcomers, every meeting would start with a re-cap of what has been accomplished with the service thus far.

### Dependencies
Interested CfB members. Even if local civil servants aren't receptive, it's still a cool opportunity to learn more about the services our localities offer and to improve members' prototype+design skills that might benefit other CfB projects.

## Affiliation
**Desired Partner**: City of Boston

**Alternate Partners:**
- Commonwealth of Massachusetts
- City of Cambridge
- City of Somerville

I have a few contacts at the City of Boston's Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics, but also once worked with the Massachusetts Digital Services team (w/ Harlan Weber) and might be able to find some State contacts as well. While I've met Nadeem Mazen once during my Code for America fellowship year, I don't have any connections in any of the other nearby local governments.

If the CfB Core Team approves this project, I can start reaching out to contacts in the above mentioned places. I don't want to reach out until it seems like something is going to move forward, as the people I'm reached out are already over booked and I don't want to take-up their time or political capital prematurely (note: this fact might be consideration for not moving forward with this project).

## Role, Background, Experience, etc.
I've been a software engineer that has to wear a lot of hats (full stack coder, user researcher, visual designer, people manager, project manager) in my short 10 year career thus far. Civic tech has been my game for the last few years, working at Code for America, US Digital Service, Massachusetts Digital Services, and Civic Actions.

For this project, I see myself taking on a few capacities as it gets started:
- Initiating the project (i.e. writing this, talking to Core Team)
- Providing connections 
- Helping folks (and myself!) learn about city/state services
- Making sure the project stays within a feasible scope that a volunteer project handle

## Resources
My network is the biggest resource that I have. With that said, I don't promise any funding or external support at the beginning.
